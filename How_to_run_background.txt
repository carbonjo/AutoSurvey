Certainly! Hereâ€™s a summarized list of the steps we took to set up your Flask application as a systemd service, ensuring it runs in the background and remains operational even when the shell is closed:

## Steps to Set Up a Flask Application as a systemd Service

### 1. Prepare Your Flask Application
- Ensure your Flask application (e.g., `app.py`) is functioning correctly in your virtual environment.

### 2. Create a systemd Service File
- Create a new service file for your application:
  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/survey_app.service
  ```
  
- Add the following content to the service file:
  ```ini
  [Unit]
  Description=Flask Application
  After=network.target

  [Service]
  User=carbonjo
  WorkingDirectory=/home/carbonjo/Auto_survey2
  Environment="PATH=/home/carbonjo/survey/bin"
  ExecStart=/home/carbonjo/survey/bin/python /home/carbonjo/Auto_survey2/app.py
  Restart=always

  [Install]
  WantedBy=multi-user.target
  ```

### 3. Check and Adjust Permissions
- Ensure the service file has the correct permissions:
  ```bash
  sudo chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/survey_app.service
  ```

### 4. Reload systemd Daemon
- After creating or modifying the service file, reload the systemd daemon to recognize the new service:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  ```

### 5. Start the Service
- Start your Flask application service:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start survey_app
  ```

### 6. Enable the Service at Boot
- Enable the service to start automatically on system boot:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl enable survey_app
  ```

### 7. Check Service Status
- Check the status of your service to ensure it is running correctly:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status survey_app
  ```

### 8. View Logs for Troubleshooting (if needed)
- If there are issues, view logs for more details:
  ```bash
  sudo journalctl -u survey_app -n 50 --no-pager
  ```

### Additional Notes:
- **Environment Variables**: Ensure any sensitive information (like API keys) is stored in a `.env` file and not hardcoded in your application.
- **Testing**: Always test your application manually before setting it up as a service to ensure it runs without errors.

This documentation should provide a clear overview of how you set up your Flask application as a systemd service. If you have any additional steps or modifications, feel free to add them!
